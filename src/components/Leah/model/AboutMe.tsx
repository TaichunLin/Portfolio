I can thrive by staying out of my comfort zone and facing uncertainty and smacking it in the face and then pressing on. Therefore, I enrolled in a J-1 program to work in Zion National Park in the US on my own. We need to exhibit a strong work ethic and collaborate with several supervisors to find the best position for you within our operations. Working as a café attendant for 3 months really helped me to respond promptly and professionally to any customer feedback, comments, or complaints.',

However, this bootcamp I joined tended to focus on web-based overall knowledge and coding rather than software engineering so I hit the ground running to seeking for a real-world job experience.',
