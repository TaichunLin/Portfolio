      'I graduated in Applied Linguistics and Language Studies from Chung Yuan Christian University. During my college years, despite taking courses from my department, I also enrolled in some courses in the department of commercial design and the department of International Trade. Besides, in my spare time, I used to take part in various extracurricular activities. All of these caused my life to diversify.',

In college, I was a College Ambassador who used to participate in a range of training sessions on Student Ambassador’s regulations, international etiquette, reception of guests and international scholars, campus tours, and more, which helped me develop exceptional interpersonal and communication skills. Furthermore, learning and working with a group of talented people enhance the quality of being expressive and proactive.',

I can thrive by staying out of my comfort zone and facing uncertainty and smacking it in the face and then pressing on. Therefore, I enrolled in a J-1 program to work in Zion National Park in the US on my own. We need to exhibit a strong work ethic and collaborate with several supervisors to find the best position for you within our operations. Working as a café attendant for 3 months helped me to respond promptly and professionally to any customer feedback, comments, or complaints.',

Therefore, I take advantage of the epidemic time to develop my technology skills. It can be daunting to acquire cross-discipline learning, so I decided to enroll in a Bootcamp to start my coding journey. After all, the only way to learn how to swim is by getting into the water.',

Through 3 months of intensive training, I gained front-end fundamentals like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP as well as web development frameworks including Bootstrap, jQuery, and technologies such as VScode and DW along with design tools, like Photoshop and XD. However, this Bootcamp I joined tended to focus on web-based overall knowledge and coding rather than software engineering; After that, I hit the ground running and sought a real-world job experience which was the full stack developer internship.',

Being a full-stack intern helps me to know more about RESTful API, SSR, CSR, etc, and see the big picture. From where I stand, web developers should not only be limited to developing web pages but should also be more exposed to other new technologies, such as AI, blockchain, and so on so that we will be able to more widely use our expertise in various fields.',
